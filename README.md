# portfolio-website

This project showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, demonstrating my ability to create responsive and visually appealing web pages. The website is designed to highlight my HTML and CSS capabilities, featuring sections for my work experience, projects, skills, and contact information. It is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Some key features of the site include responsive design, a clean and modern user interface, interactive elements using CSS animations and transitions, a portfolio showcase displaying my best projects and work samples, and a contact form for easy communication. The technologies used in this project are HTML5 for structure and content, CSS3 for styling, layout, and responsive design, as well as Flexbox and Grid for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
